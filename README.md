## Project Overview
Welcome to the "120 Years of Olympic History" SQL Database Project. This project dives into a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, covering a century of Olympic Games. Our goal was to analyze this rich dataset and derive meaningful insights from it through SQL queries.

## Key Highlights
### Data Source: 
  We leveraged a Kaggle dataset, a treasure trove of information encompassing 120 years of Olympic history, with data on athletes, events, countries, and medals.

### Queries: 
   We tackled ten problem statement queries, each designed to extract valuable information and insights from the data. From medal counts to athlete statistics, these queries helped us gain 
   a deep understanding of Olympic history.

### SQL Functions: 
  To efficiently answer these queries, we employed SQL JOIN functions to connect and integrate data from multiple tables. We also made extensive use of Common Table 
  Expressions (CTE) for complex queries, ensuring the most efficient and readable code.
  
## Query Examples
One of the most notable queries we executed involved using JOIN functions and CTE to find the total gold, silver, and bronze medals won by each country. This allowed us to present an overview of each country's Olympic performance over the years.
